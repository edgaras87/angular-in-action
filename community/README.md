# Routing

## ActivatedRoute
Many of the values returned by ActivatedRoute are exposed as observables, so youâ€™ll have to subscribe 
to get the values. The primary reason why is that when you have nested routes where a parent and child 
route are active at the same time, a parent component can subscribe to get updates as any child routes 
are loaded.
